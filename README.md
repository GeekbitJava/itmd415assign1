# Advanced Software Development Assignment 1
Using java.net.* package implement the following:

1. a server class that is capable of handling clients requests as follows:

   * clients send a messages to the server the server respond that It got the message (515OK)  
   * clients messages are request to a simple math calculation for example if a client sends 3 * 5 the server responds with 3 * 5 = 15. supported operations are (+,-,/,//,% and *)
   * Server needs to keep count of number of clients connected to it.  
   * if client send "COUNT" message the server responds with the total number of clients connected to it.  
   * Client and server needs to be a 100% in synch.   
  
2. a Client class that simulates clients and support the above functionality.

Side note: 
Try to get Eclipse and Git to sync up with each other to make commits easier.
We had many issues with this. 
We also created an organization called GeekbitJava for us to use for all the assignments and projects.
